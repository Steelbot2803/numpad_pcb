# 🧮 Custom Mechanical Numpad – PCB & Enclosure Design

This repository contains the full design files for a **custom mechanical numpad** featuring a rotary encoder (knob) and linear potentiometer (slider). Built purely as a **passion project**, this numpad was never intended for mass production—just a sandbox to challenge myself and learn more about electronics, PCB design, and enclosure prototyping.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ **Fully custom PCB** designed in **KiCad 7**
- 🖱️ Supports **Cherry MX-style switches** (hot-swappable footprints)
- 🎛️ Integrated **rotary encoder knob**
- 🎚️ Integrated **slider / linear potentiometer**
- 📦 Enclosure and parts modeled in **Fusion 360**
- ⚡ Prototype-only – not manufactured (yet!)

---

## 🧩 Tools & Software Used

- **KiCad 7** – Schematic & PCB layout
- **Fusion 360** – 3D modeling for the shell and key layout
- **FlatCAM** (optional, for CNC PCB milling)
- **FreeCAD** (optional, for STEP file cleanup)
